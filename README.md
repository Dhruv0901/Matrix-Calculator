# Matrix-Calculator

1. This is a matrix calculator. Just solve your matrix problems in 3 easy steps:-

        Optional step: Enter the formula in which you want to solve those matrix Q.s
        Step 1: Enter the order of that matrix
        Step 2: Enter the elements of that matrix
        Step 3: Enter the operation you want to perform on that matrices

2. All the operational functions and other functions are there in MatrixOperation class and Matrix class respectively.
 
3. The code both the classes are there in a different python file and here that class is imported using static import.

4. This is a raw python program based calculator. The UI of this calculator will be there on play store after few months/year.

5. Clone/download the class file and add that file to your project folder.

6. If you're using this code them make sure that, you've changed the path/folder in the import statement according to your file location.

       * For Exampel:- In my case its: from Personal_Projects.Matrix_calculator.matrix_class import Matrix
        
       * But in your case, it could be from ________.________.matrix_class import Matrix
                                                
                                                or
                                               
                                       from matrix_class import Matrix
                                      
       * Or you can put all code (including the classes) in one single file.
